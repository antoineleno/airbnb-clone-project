> **A Full-Stack Backend Simulation Project — Learn, Build, Scale!**  
> *Project Duration:* April 28, 2025 5:00 AM → May 5, 2025 5:00 AM

---

## 📜 Project Overview
The **StayBackend: Airbnb Clone** is a comprehensive backend project simulating the core systems of a real-world booking platform like Airbnb.  
It focuses on backend development, database modeling, API security, CI/CD pipelines, and collaborative software engineering workflows.

This project strengthens **technical depth** and **teamwork skills**, creating a foundation to build **scalable**, **secure**, and **efficient** backend systems.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
✅ Master GitHub team workflows and collaboration.  
✅ Deepen backend architecture and relational database design expertise.  
✅ Implement secure RESTful APIs with industry best practices.  
✅ Understand and integrate CI/CD pipelines for faster deployments.  
✅ Practice documenting and structuring large-scale projects.  
✅ Work with Django, MySQL, GraphQL, and Docker for modern backend ecosystems.

---

## 🔑 Requirements
- GitHub account and repository management skills.
- Familiarity with Markdown for documentation.
- Experience with Django or similar backend frameworks.
- Understanding of MySQL database systems.
- Knowledge of security best practices and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Docker, etc).

## 👥 Team Roles
| Role                     | Responsibility |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Product Owner**         | Defines the project vision and prioritizes development tasks to maximize value delivery. |
| **Project Manager (PM)**  | Organizes the team’s activities, sets deadlines, coordinates work, and ensures project delivery on schedule. |
| **Backend Developers**    | Design and build the backend systems, REST APIs, and database models using Django and MySQL. |
| **DevOps Engineer**       | Sets up, maintains, and optimizes CI/CD pipelines, manages Docker environments, and automates deployment processes. |
| **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer** | Tests and validates application features, ensures that APIs meet security and functionality requirements. |
| **Database Administrator (DBA)** | Designs relational database structures, manages migrations, ensures database performance and security. |
| **Security Engineer**     | Implements API authentication, authorization, and other cybersecurity measures to protect the system. |
| **UI/UX Designer**         | *(Optional in this backend-focused phase)* Designs API responses and data contracts to ensure smooth frontend-backend integration.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
| Technology        | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Django**        | Backend web framework for creating robust RESTful APIs. |
| **MySQL**         | Relational database management system (RDBMS) for structured data storage. |
| **GraphQL**       | API query language offering flexible and efficient data fetching. |
| **Docker**        | Containerization tool for replicable development and production environments. |
| **GitHub Actions**| CI/CD automation to test and deploy the application efficiently. |
| **PostgreSQL** *(optional alternative)* | Advanced database options if needed for scaling. |

## 🗂️ Database Design
Entities:

- **User**  
  Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `created_at`

- **Property**  
  Fields: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`

- **Booking**  
  Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`

- **Review**  
  Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`

- **Payment**  
  Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `payment_date`, `payment_method`, `amount`

**Relationships:**
- A `User` can have many `Properties` and `Bookings`.
- A `Property` can have many `Bookings` and `Reviews`.
- A `Booking` is linked to a `User`, a `Property`, and has one `Payment`.

## 🚀 Feature Breakdown
| Feature            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **User Management**| User registration, login, profile management, and authentication system. |
| **Property Management** | Property owners can list, update, and delete properties. |
| **Booking System** | Users can book available properties for specific dates, calculate prices dynamically. |
| **Payment Processing** | Secure and transparent handling of payments linked to bookings. |
| **Review System** | Users can submit reviews for properties they've booked, helping future users. |
| **API Security** | Protect APIs using authentication, authorization, and secure data transmission. |
| **Continuous Deployment** | Streamlined updates via automated CI/CD pipelines for faster iteration. |

---

## 🔐 API Security Overview
Security is critical for building trust and protecting user data. Key measures include:

- **Authentication**  
  Verifying user identity using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.

- **Authorization**  
  Ensuring users access only resources they're permitted to (e.g., booking only their own stays).

- **Data Validation & Sanitization**  
  Preventing SQL Injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.

- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**  
  Preventing abuse and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.

- **Secure Payments**  
  Encrypting sensitive transaction details and validating payment sessions.

---

## 📅 Timeline
- **Start Date:** April 28, 2025  
- **End Date:** May 5, 2025

✅ Manual QA review must be requested after completing all tasks.  
✅ Automatic review will launch at the final deadline.
