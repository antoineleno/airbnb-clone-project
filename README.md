## 🧠 Team Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧑‍💻 Backend Developer | Builds the RESTful APIs using Django, handles logic, routing, and middleware. |
| 🧑‍🔧 Database Administrator | Designs and optimizes the relational database schema (MySQL). |
| 🧑‍💼 DevOps Engineer | Manages CI/CD, Docker environments, and GitHub Actions pipelines. |
| 🛡️ Security Analyst | Implements API authentication, rate-limiting, and data protection mechanisms. |
| 📋 Technical Writer | Writes documentation and ensures all specs, APIs, and setup instructions are clear and professional. |

---

## 🧰 Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| 🐍 **Python** | Base language for backend development. |
| 🌐 **Django** | Backend framework for rapid development of REST APIs. |
| 🗃️ **MySQL** | Relational database for structured data storage. |
| 🔌 **GraphQL** | Query language for flexible client-server communication. |
| 🐳 **Docker** | Containerization platform to standardize environments. |
| 🚀 **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD automation for testing and deployment. |
| 🛡️ **JWT/OAuth2** | Authentication methods for secure access control. |

## 🗄️ Database Design

**Entities and Key Fields:**

- **Users**
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
- **Properties**
  - `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `location`, `price_per_night`
- **Bookings**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
- **Payments**
  - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `timestamp`
- **Reviews**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`

**Relationships:**
- A `User` can own multiple `Properties`.
- A `Booking` is linked to one `User` and one `Property`.
- A `Payment` is tied to a specific `Booking`.
- A `Review` is written by a `User` about a `Property`.

## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 👥 **User Management** | Registration, login, role-based access (host/guest), password hashing. |
| 🏘️ **Property Management** | Hosts can list, update, or remove properties; includes image upload support. |
| 📅 **Booking System** | Guests can view availability, create bookings, and manage reservations. |
| 💳 **Payment Processing** | Secure handling of payments linked to bookings using payment gateways. |
| ⭐ **Review System** | Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve stayed at. |
| 🔍 **Search & Filter** | Users can search listings by location, price, and availability. |

## 🔐 API Security

**Implemented Security Measures:**

| Security Feature | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| 🔐 **JWT Authentication** | Ensures only authenticated users can access protected endpoints. |
| 🛡️ **Role-Based Authorization** | Restricts access based on user type (host vs. guest). |
| 🧱 **Rate Limiting** | Prevents abuse by limiting the number of API requests per minute. |
| 🔍 **Input Validation & Sanitization** | Protects against SQL injection and XSS attacks. |
| 🔒 **HTTPS Encryption (optional)** | Ensures data-in-transit security for all API calls. |

**Why It Matters:**

- 🧍‍♂️ **Protects user data** (emails, passwords, personal info)
- 💳 **Secures financial transactions**
- 🔄 **Ensures system integrity** against bots and bad actors

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

**Overview:**
- **GitHub Actions** handles:
  - Code formatting and lint checks
  - Unit and integration testing
  - Docker container build and push
  - Deployment to staging or production environments

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 Faster deployments
- 📦 Fewer bugs
- 🔁 Continuous feedback for developers
